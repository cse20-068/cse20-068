                                    The City of London is a city, ceremonial county and local government 
                                    district[note 1] that contains the historic centre and the primary central 
                                    business district (CBD) of London. It constituted most of London from its 
                                    settlement by the Romans in the 1st century AD to the Middle Ages, but the 
                                    modern city named London has since grown far beyond the City of London boundary.

                                <p>
                                    The City is now only a tiny part of the metropolis of London, though it remains a
                                     notable part of central London. Administratively, it forms one of the 33 local 
                                     authority districts of London; however, the City of London is not a London borough, 
                                     a status reserved for the other 32 districts (including London's only other city, 
                                     the City of Westminster).

                                    It is also a separate ceremonial county, being an enclave surrounded by Greater 
                                     London, and is the smallest county in the United Kingdom.
